# Snake-game
I made Snake Game using python,
A fun project to create a simple Snake game implemented with pygame. If you have ever owned a Nokia phone, you would be familiar with this game.
Implemented game mechanics, including snake movement, food generation, and collision detection.

Steps:

1)Installing Pygame
2)Create the Screen
3)Create the Snake
4)Moving the Snake
4)Game Over when Snake hits the boundaries
5)Adding the Food
6)Increasing the Length of the Snake
7)Displaying the Score
